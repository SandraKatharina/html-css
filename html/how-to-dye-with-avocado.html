            <h2>The things you need:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A white T-Shirt (size M or L)</li>
                <li>3-6 avocado pits and skin</li>
                <li>Large pot (big enough so your shirt can float in the water)</li>
                <li>1/4 Teaspoon Laundry detergent or any clear unscented soap</li>
                <li>1/8 cup + 30 g Soda ash (sold at drug stores and grocery stores as laundry detergent)</li>
                <li>Metal or plastic utensil for stirring</li>
                <li>60 g Alum (often found in the spices section at grocery stores)</li>
                <li>600 ml White Vinegar</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

                Place your avocado pits and skins in the pot and fill with water. 
                Bring to a boil and turn down the heat to a simmer. Let simmer for one hour. 
                Your water should change color: 
                If you're using avocado, the water should be a reddish-pink color. 
                After an hour, turn off the heat and let your dye bath sit overnight 
                (letting it sit overnight will create a brighter dye.)
                The next day, remove the onion or avocado from the dye water.

                Fill your pot with water and add laundry detergent (or neutral soap) and soda ash. 
                Bring the water to a boil and submerge your clean, dry t-shirt in the water. 
                Turn the heat down to a simmer. Stir your shirt constantly for the first two minutes, 
                and then every 10 minutes for one hour. 
                You might notice that the water turns a yellow color - that's okay! Wapner says that 
                during the clothing manufacturing process, different waxes, spinning materials and oils 
                can get onto your shirt. This step will help clean your shirt as thoroughly as possible to 
                remove any "color-shifters" so that when you apply the onion skins or avocado, the shirt 
                will take the dye evenly. Remove your shirt from the pot of water. Wring out your shirt and let it dry.
                For a size medium to large t-shirt, pour 600 g vinegar, 60 g alum and 30 g soda ash into your pot. 
                If your shirt is bigger or smaller, adjust accordingly â€” the ratio is 10:1:.5. 
                Dip your dry shirt into the pot and make sure it's fully saturated. 
                Gently squeeze out the shirt and hang to dry.

                Bring your dye bath back to a boil. While you're waiting for the dye to come to a boil, 
                fill a separate pot with water, and submerge your shirt in the water. This will help your 
                shirt take the dye evenly when you submerge it in the dye bath. Once the dye is boiling, 
                wring out the excess water from the shirt and place it in the dye bath. Again, stir the 
                shirt constantly for two minutes. Stir the shirt every 10 minutes for the next hour.
                Remove the shirt from the dye bath. (Wapner says the shirt will look more pigmented when it's wet 
                and will dry about two shades lighter). Rinse in water or with a bit of laundry detergent 
                and let your shirt air-dry.
